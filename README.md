Droidwheel is an application that uses various android sensor fusions in order to detect rotation around z axis (or yaw). This in connection with some basic code on server side that uses ViGemBus allows users to use phone as a 900 degree wheel in driving simulation games.

After looking for an application with this funtionality the only app I came accross used only accelerometer sensor, which resulted in highly inaccurate readings.
Code concerning sensor fusions is licensed under MIT license, which is included in appropriate files.

Missing funtions:
- Various controll buttons, sliders (some of them hopefully utilizing sensor readings)
- Displaying parts of a Windows screen in center instead of wheel
- Proper settings menu (including dark mode toggle, changing size of an central image)
